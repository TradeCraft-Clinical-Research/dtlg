# Generate Core Safety Tables for Clinical Study Reports

`AET01_table()` produces and combines the main safety summary tables
typically found in Section 14.3.1 of a Clinical Study Report (CSR). It
calculates patient counts and event totals for deaths, AE-related
withdrawals, total AEs, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs).

## Usage

``` r
AET01_table(
  adsl,
  adae,
  patient_var,
  treat_var,
  aesi_vars,
  aesi_heading = "Total number of patients with at least one",
  indent = "  "
)
```

## Arguments

- adsl:

  A subject-level dataset (typically ADaM ADSL).

- adae:

  A dataset of adverse events, preprocessed with AESI flags.

- patient_var:

  A string indicating the subject identifier variable (e.g.,
  `"USUBJID"`).

- treat_var:

  A string indicating the treatment arm variable (e.g., `"ARM"`).

- aesi_vars:

  A character vector of binary AESI flags in `adae`.

- aesi_heading:

  Optional character string used as a heading in the AESI block.

- indent:

  A string used to indent AESI row labels (default is 2 spaces).

## Value

A merged `data.table` summarising the main safety outcomes.

## Examples

``` r
AET01_summary <- AET01_table(
  adsl = adsl,
  adae = aesi,
  patient_var = "USUBJID",
  treat_var = "ARM",
  aesi_vars = c("FATAL", "SER", "SERWD", "SERDSM", "RELSER",
                "WD", "DSM", "REL", "RELWD", "RELDSM", "SEV")
)
print(AET01_summary)
